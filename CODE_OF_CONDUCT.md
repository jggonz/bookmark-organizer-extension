## Our Standards

**Positive behaviors include:**

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and may temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the repository, issue tracker, and any other forums created by the project team. It also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting the project maintainers directly. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
